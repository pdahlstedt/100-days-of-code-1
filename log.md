# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to set up environments, Git. Then generated a react app - but after a while found the FCC (FreeCodeCamp)
Started with the basics html and css.

**Thoughts:** Thought I knew this... but it has happened so much and I have never really worked with I really struggled with CSS, but I have never really worked with web development. Good start and impressed by FCC and CodePen.io. Feels like a long way to actually start working with javascript.

### Day 2: May 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** This is really on my mind. Flew to Skellefte√• and back today but managed to work with some code for FreeCodeCamp both before and during the flight. Spent an additional hour once I was back home.

### Day 4: May 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the basic Javascript training in FreeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts** Syntactic similar to C++ and C# but also many differences. Fun to code, even the simpler examples give you a good idea.
Simpler, elegant and powerful - waiting to unleash the power.

### Day 5

**Today's Progress**: Completed the ES6 training in FreeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts** ES6 adds some nice additions to JavaScript - needs to sink in for a while though. Straightened a lot of questionsmarks.

### Day 6

**Today's Progress**: Started regular expressions for Javascript in FreeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts** Lots of other things happened today but managed to find some time for regular expressions. The regular expressions in javascript are powerful but the tests in the training was not so good. Looking forward to master javascript so much so I can start with React, Electron and Express ;)
