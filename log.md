# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to set up environments, Git. Then generated a react app - but after a while found the FCC (FreeCodeCamp)
Started with the basics html and css.

**Thoughts:** Thought I knew this... but it has happened so much and I have never really worked with I really struggled with CSS, but I have never really worked with web development. Good start and impressed by FCC and CodePen.io. Feels like a long way to actually start working with javascript.

### Day 1: May 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** This is really on my mind. Flew to Skellefte√• and back today but managed to work with some code for FreeCodeCamp both before and during the flight. Spent an additional hour once I was back home.
